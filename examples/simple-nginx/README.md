## Running your first containers in Kubernetes

Ok, you've run one of the [getting started guides](../docs/getting-started-guides/) and you have
successfully turned up a Kubernetes cluster.  Now what?  This guide will help you get oriented
to Kubernetes and running your first containers on the cluster.
The example is easy enough to use and understand.

### Create the nginx replicated pods

From this point onwards, it is assumed that `kubectl` is on your path from one of the getting started guides.

The [`kubectl create`](../docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl_create.md) line below will create two [nginx](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) [pods](../docs/user-guide/pods.md) listening on port 80. It will also create a [replication controller](../docs/user-guide/replication-controller.md) named `nginx-controller` to ensure that there are always two pods running.

```bash
kubectl create -f nginx-controller.yaml
```
Where nginx-controller.yaml contains something like:
<!-- BEGIN MUNGE: EXAMPLE pod.yaml -->

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: nginx-controller
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    name: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

```

[Download example](nginx-controller.yaml?raw=true)
<!-- END MUNGE: EXAMPLE pod.yaml -->


Once the pods are created, you can list them to see what is up and running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

You can also see the replication controller that was created:

```bash
kubectl get rc
```

To stop the two replicated containers, stop the replication controller:

```bash
kubectl stop rc my-nginx
```

### Create the nginx service

Define [nginx-service-clusterip](nginx-service-clusterip.yaml):

```bash
kubectl create -f nginx-service-clusterip.yaml
```

This should print the service that has been created, and map an external IP address to the service. Where to find this external IP address will depend on the environment you run in. Another way is define nginx-service-nodeport.yaml.

```console
$ kubectl get services
NAME                      CLUSTER_IP      EXTERNAL_IP   PORT(S)    SELECTOR     AGE
kubernetes                192.168.3.1     <none>        443/TCP    <none>       1d
nginx-service-clusterip   192.168.3.232   <none>        8001/TCP   name=nginx   6h

```

In order to access your nginx landing page, you also have to make sure that traffic from external IPs is allowed. Do this by opening a firewall to allow traffic on port 8001.

### Accessing the nginx site externally

On any node in cluster, you can use curl to confirm service and nginx is running. 
```console
$ curl  192.168.3.232:8001
